# avo-PC

This README file will attempt to illustrate the purpose of this repository file labeled as "avo-PC."

In this repository, you will find various, small-scale projects that user "andyyvo" has done on his free time.
Most of the work is probably done in Python or Java.
The work most likely originates from his classwork projects and extension of those projects or from his free time.
These works (as of current) are from his second year of college at Boston University since he recently switched majors
from Biochemistry/Molecular Biology (pre-med) to Computer Science with a minor in Biology (no longer pre-med).

Hope this helps :)
